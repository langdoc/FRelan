\usage{
read_eaf(eaf_file, ind_tier = "refT", sa_tier = "orthT",
  ss_tier = "wordT")
}
\arguments{
\item{eaf_file}{The path to ELAN file which we want to parse}

\item{sa_tier}{Linguistic type of the Symbolic Association tier}

\item{ss_tier}{Linguistic type of the Symbolic Subdivision tier (usually contains the tokenized wordforms)}

\item{def_tier}{Linguistic type of the independent tier}
}
\description{
This is an updated version of the old function, which has been renamed to read_eaf_old(). Instead of trying to do everything this function is supposedly used with `plyr` in order to parse multiple files. The function parses ELAN files. The error messages are stored on utterance column, from where one should probably remove them before proceeding. In actual use the biggest problems are connected to structural irregularity of ELAN files in corpus. It is used ideally in connection with scripts that are able to parse IMDI or CMDI files. Please use `log_eaf()` function to see which files have been changed recently, those are usually the ones containing problems.
